To create Terraform code for an Azure Databricks workspace and cluster, follow these steps:

Install the Azure CLI: The Azure CLI provides command-line interface for interacting with Azure resources. Install it from the official Microsoft website.

Install the Terraform: Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that helps you define and manage your infrastructure as code. Install it from the official Terraform website.

Authenticate to Azure: Use the Azure CLI to authenticate to your Azure account by running the following command in your terminal:

Copy code
az login
Create an Azure Resource Group: A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources. Create a resource group by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
az group create --name <resource-group-name> --location <azure-region>
Replace <resource-group-name> with your preferred name for the resource group and <azure-region> with the region you want to deploy your resources in.

Create an Azure Databricks Workspace: Use the Terraform code to create an Azure Databricks workspace by creating a new file named main.tf and adding the following code:

arduino
Copy code
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_databricks_workspace" "databricks" {
  name                = "<workspace-name>"
  location            = "<azure-region>"
  resource_group_name = "<resource-group-name>"
  sku_name            = "premium"
  tags                = {
    environment = "dev"
  }
}
Replace <workspace-name> with your preferred name for the Databricks workspace.

Create an Azure Databricks Cluster: Use the Terraform code to create an Azure Databricks cluster by adding the following code to the main.tf file:

arduino
Copy code
resource "azurerm_databricks_cluster" "cluster" {
  name                = "<cluster-name>"
  location            = "<azure-region>"
  resource_group_name = "<resource-group-name>"
  num_workers         = 2
  node_type_id        = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  spark_version       = "7.3.x-scala2.12"
  spark_conf = {
    "spark.speculation" = "true"
  }
  tags                = {
    environment = "dev"
  }
  workspace_url = azurerm_databricks_workspace.databricks.workspace_url
}
Replace <cluster-name> with your preferred name for the Databricks cluster.

Initialize and apply the Terraform code: Run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration and apply it to create the Azure Databricks workspace and cluster:

csharp
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
Confirm the creation of the resources when prompted.

Your Terraform code for creating an Azure Databricks workspace and cluster is now complete.

what is databrick provider in terraform
The Databricks provider in Terraform is a plugin that enables Terraform to interact with Azure Databricks workspaces and clusters. It allows you to define and manage your Databricks resources, such as workspaces, clusters, jobs, and notebooks, as code.

The Databricks provider provides a set of resources and data sources that you can use to manage your Databricks infrastructure. For example, you can use the azurerm_databricks_workspace resource to create a Databricks workspace, the azurerm_databricks_cluster resource to create a Databricks cluster, and the azurerm_databricks_job resource to create a Databricks job.

The provider also supports various configuration options, such as the location and size of the Databricks cluster, the Spark version to use, and the authentication method to use when accessing the Databricks workspace.

To use the Databricks provider, you need to configure it with your Azure credentials and Databricks API token. Once you have done this, you can write your Terraform configuration files to create and manage your Databricks resources.

Overall, the Databricks provider in Terraform is a useful tool for managing Databricks resources in a scalable and repeatable manner.




Mohammed Zeeshan
databrick provider code in terraform
To use the Databricks provider in Terraform, you need to add it to your Terraform configuration file as follows:

Add the provider block to your Terraform code, and specify the version you want to use:

arduino
Copy code
provider "databricks" {
  version = "0.4.0"
}
Configure the provider with your Azure credentials and Databricks API token:

arduino
Copy code
provider "databricks" {
  version = "0.4.0"

  azure_tenant_id = "<azure-tenant-id>"
  client_id       = "<client-id>"
  client_secret   = "<client-secret>"
  workspace_url   = "<workspace-url>"
  api_token       = "<api-token>"
}
Replace <azure-tenant-id>, <client-id>, <client-secret>, <workspace-url>, and <api-token> with your own values.

Define your Databricks resources using the Databricks provider resources. For example, to create a Databricks cluster, you can use the databricks_cluster resource:

arduino
Copy code
resource "databricks_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  cluster_name           = "example-cluster"
  spark_version          = "8.0.x-scala2.12"
  node_type_id           = "Standard_D3_v2"
  num_workers            = 2
  auto_termination_minutes = 30

  spark_conf {
    "spark.speculation" = "true"
  }

  azure_attributes {
    availability = "ON_DEMAND_AVAILABILITY"
  }

  ssh_public_keys {
    key_name = "example_key"
    public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDLfDOYrV7q......"
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "dev"
  }
}
This code creates a cluster named example-cluster with two workers of size Standard_D3_v2, using Spark version 8.0.x-scala2.12. It also sets some Spark configuration properties and sets some Azure-specific attributes. In addition, it adds an SSH public key to the cluster for access to the worker nodes.

Overall, the Databricks provider in Terraform provides a convenient way to manage your Databricks resources in a scalable and repeatable manner.

how to create datgabrick not type in terraform
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "not type" in Terraform. If you could please provide more context or clarify your question, I would be happy to assist you further.

In general, to create a Databricks workspace and cluster using Terraform, you would define the necessary resources and configurations in your Terraform code, and then apply the code to create the resources in Azure. Here are the general steps you would take:

Install and configure Terraform to work with Azure and the Databricks provider.
Write Terraform code to define the Databricks workspace and cluster resources, including their location, size, and configuration settings.
Use the terraform init command to initialize your Terraform workspace with the necessary plugins and modules.
Use the terraform plan command to preview the changes that Terraform will make to your Azure resources.
Use the terraform apply command to create the Databricks workspace and cluster in Azure.
Once the resources are created, you can manage them using Terraform, and make any necessary changes to their configuration using your Terraform code.
Note that these are general steps, and the specific details and configurations of your Terraform code will depend on your specific use case and requirements.




Mohammed Zeeshan
data brick node type code in terraform
In Terraform, you can specify the node type for your Databricks cluster using the node_type_id parameter in the databricks_cluster resource. The node_type_id parameter specifies the ID of the Azure Virtual Machine type to use for the worker nodes in the Databricks cluster.

Here is an example of how to specify the node_type_id parameter in your Terraform code:

bash
Copy code
resource "databricks_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  cluster_name           = "example-cluster"
  spark_version          = "7.3.x-scala2.12"
  node_type_id           = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  num_workers            = 2
  auto_termination_minutes = 60

  # other configuration parameters for the cluster...

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
In this example, the node_type_id parameter is set to "Standard_DS3_v2", which corresponds to the Azure Virtual Machine type Standard_DS3_v2. You can find a list of valid node types for Databricks clusters in Azure in the Azure Databricks documentation.

Note that the cost and performance of your Databricks cluster will depend on the node type that you select, as well as the other configuration parameters that you specify in your Terraform code.

in terraform databricks_spark_version" "latest_lts"
In Terraform, you can set the Spark version for your Databricks cluster using the spark_version parameter in the databricks_cluster resource. If you want to use the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Spark available in Databricks, you can set the spark_version parameter to "latest_lts".

Here is an example of how to set the spark_version parameter to "latest_lts" in your Terraform code:

bash
Copy code
resource "databricks_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  cluster_name           = "example-cluster"
  spark_version          = "latest_lts"
  node_type_id           = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  num_workers            = 2
  auto_termination_minutes = 60

  # other configuration parameters for the cluster...

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
In this example, the spark_version parameter is set to "latest_lts", which tells Databricks to use the latest LTS version of Spark available. Note that this may change over time as new LTS versions are released.

Alternatively, you can specify a specific version of Spark that you want to use in your Databricks cluster by setting the spark_version parameter to the appropriate version string. You can find a list of available Spark versions in Databricks in the Databricks Runtime Release Notes.

what is code in terrafoprm databricks_instance_pool" "pool"
In Terraform, you can define a Databricks Instance Pool using the databricks_instance_pool resource. An Instance Pool is a group of Databricks worker nodes that can be dynamically scaled up or down in response to changes in workload.

Here is an example of how to define a databricks_instance_pool resource in Terraform:

bash
Copy code
resource "databricks_instance_pool" "pool" {
  instance_pool_name = "example-pool"
  node_type_id       = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  min_idle_instances = 0
  max_capacity       = 10

  # other configuration parameters for the instance pool...

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
In this example, the databricks_instance_pool resource is defined with the name "pool". The instance_pool_name parameter specifies the name of the instance pool in Databricks, and the node_type_id parameter specifies the ID of the Azure Virtual Machine type to use for the worker nodes in the instance pool. The min_idle_instances parameter specifies the minimum number of idle instances to keep running in the instance pool, and the max_capacity parameter specifies the maximum number of instances that can be added to the pool.

You can also specify other configuration parameters for the instance pool in your Terraform code, such as the cluster configuration to use for the worker nodes, and the tags to apply to the instance pool.

Once you have defined your databricks_instance_pool resource in Terraform, you can use it in conjunction with other Databricks resources, such as the databricks_cluster resource, to create a fully-configured Databricks environment that can be automatically managed and scaled using Terraform.

in terraform The argument "idle_instance_autotermination_minutes" is required, but no definition was found.
The error message "The argument 'idle_instance_autotermination_minutes' is required, but no definition was found" means that you have not defined the idle_instance_autotermination_minutes argument for your Databricks Instance Pool resource in Terraform.

The idle_instance_autotermination_minutes argument specifies the number of minutes after which idle instances in the instance pool will be automatically terminated. This is an important parameter to set in order to avoid unnecessary costs for unused resources.

To fix the error, you need to add the idle_instance_autotermination_minutes argument to your databricks_instance_pool resource in your Terraform code. Here is an example of how to do this:

bash
Copy code
resource "databricks_instance_pool" "pool" {
  instance_pool_name                 = "example-pool"
  node_type_id                       = "Standard_DS3_v2"
  min_idle_instances                 = 0
  max_capacity                       = 10
  idle_instance_autotermination_minutes = 30

  # other configuration parameters for the instance pool...

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
In this example, the idle_instance_autotermination_minutes argument is set to 30, which means that idle instances in the instance pool will be automatically terminated after 30 minutes of inactivity.

By defining this parameter in your Terraform code, you can ensure that your Databricks Instance Pool is configured to automatically manage idle resources and minimize unnecessary costs.
